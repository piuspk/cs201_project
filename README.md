**RMQ Implementation Using Sparse Table**:
This project is part of a Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course and focuses on implementing the Range Minimum and Maximum Query (RMQ) using the Sparse Table data structure. The Sparse Table is a powerful data structure that efficiently solves static range query problems, such as minimum and maximum queries. The implementation aims to achieve a runtime of O(1) on average.

Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop an efficient implementation of the RMQ problem using the Sparse Table data structure. The Sparse Table allows for fast computation of range queries on a static array. By preprocessing the input array, the Sparse Table achieves a time complexity of O(1) for answering queries.

The project includes the following components:
Main.c: The main implementation file containing the code for building the Sparse Table and answering RMQ queries.
